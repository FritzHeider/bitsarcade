# BitsArcade

This repository contains a Laravel-based project. The original codebase did not include any automated test scaffolding, which made it difficult to verify changes.

## Running tests

1. Install PHP dependencies (including development packages):
   ```bash
   composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```
2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

Currently only a placeholder test exists. Front-end tests have not been set up yet.

For additional details about the project, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).
