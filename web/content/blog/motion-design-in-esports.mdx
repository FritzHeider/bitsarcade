Esports broadcasts thrive on hype loops, not static overlays. Our motion designers blend GSAP timelines with data feeds to keep every frame reactive.

## Blend stats with spectacle

Stats should explode onto the screen without jarring the viewer. We use ScrollTrigger and live data to choreograph transitions that feel alive and informative.

## Automate highlight reels

BitsArcade pipelines capture standout plays, trim them with AI markers, and layer GSAP-driven supers so social teams can publish in seconds.

## Keep latency low

Animations are only thrilling when they track the moment. Our render stack keeps animations under 50ms so the roar hits in sync with the play.
