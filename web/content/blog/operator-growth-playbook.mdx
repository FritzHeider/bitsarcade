Growth without guardrails collapses under pressure. We built BitsArcade to pair ambitious live ops with automated compliance so studios can expand without burning teams out.

## Calibrate retention loops

Use cohort analytics to ship daily, weekly, and seasonal missions that celebrate progress. Layer in GSAP micro-moments for rewards that feel bespoke.

## Turn VIPs into advocates

Progressive perks work when hosts have context. Feed player health, AML status, and wagering trends into a single surface so your VIP team can act faster.

## Instrument every experiment

From push campaigns to bonus drops, track uplift with native attribution and webhooks that talk to your stack. BitsArcade pipelines close the loop between marketing and gameplay in realtime.
